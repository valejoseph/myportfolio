<h5>My Portfolio</h5>
<h4>Welcome!</h4>
<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. My name is Valerie Joseph, I was born and raised in Haiti. I migrated to the US at the age of 12. I am proud to be the first in my family to graduate from col. I am passionate about technology. real estate, and trading. I have six yearsâ€™ professional experience working as a Computer System Analyst for one of the largest healthcare organization in New Jersey. My passion for technology stem from my curiosity of how things work. I graduated from Rutgers University with Major in Management Information systems and a minor in Computer Science. I sam currently pursuing a certificate in Web Development at Boston University. My goal is to work as a freelance Web Developer. I also plan on using my knowledge and experience to teach the youth in Haiti how to code. It is a long dream of mine to give back to hometown. Overall, I am vivid learner and I always go above and beyond in everything that I do. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, cooking and meditating. I look forward to connecting and working with you.</p>
