Objective: This website will be a working progress for my portfolio and final project

about.html-the about page will displayed some basic information about myself. I have added more pictures to create a gallery and a video.  I did not like the video display in the gallery so I removed it and add it toward the bottom.

services.html - I have added some services that I will provided. I do not have past work to showcases so eventually this page will be revamp. I added those services in a table as of now I am actively looking for ways to design that better

index.html- this is a simple page. it has my picture only.

contactme.html - this page is almost how I envisoned it to be. the send a message button is not working at the moment. i plan to work on it before as a final homework challenge. 

I commented it out the print part of the homework because i am not too clear on what I am supposed to do. I thought I understood. Sublime also does not have printing capability.
